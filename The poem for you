     To MY Wife (Oscar Wilde)
     
I can write no stately proem          //我写不出华丽的序言
As a prelude to my lay                //作为这些短歌的序曲
From a poet to a poem                 //我胆敢在此说出的只是 一个诗人到一首诗
I would dare to say

For if of these fallen petals          //倘若这些凋落的残花
Once to you seem fair,                 //能有一朵你觉得美丽
Love will waft it till it settles      //爱就会将它吹送
On your hair.                          //安息在你的发丝

And when wind and winter harden,       //当北风与冬天让一切凝固
All the loveless land,                 //一切变成爱的荒原
It will whisper of the garden,         //它就会低诉花园的絮语
You will understand                    //你就会恍然大悟
